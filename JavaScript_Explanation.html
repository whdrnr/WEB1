        <p>
            JavaScript (English: JavaScript) is an object-based script programming language. 
            This language is mainly used within a web browser and has the ability to access embedded objects of other applications. 
            It is also used for server programming, such as runtime environments such as Node.js. 
            JavaScript was originally developed by Brendan Eich of Netscape Communications Corporation under the name Mocha at first, 
            and later under the name LiveScript, and finally became JavaScript.
