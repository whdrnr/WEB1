        <p>
            The dependent sheet or cascading style sheets (CSS) is a style sheet language that describes how the markup language is actually displayed [1], 
            and is mainly used in HTML and XHTML, and is also used in XML. It is the standard of W3C, 
            and has a high degree of freedom when defining layouts and styles. The default file name [2] is style.css.
            If markup language (ex: HTML) is in charge of the body of the website, 
            CSS can be said to be in charge of decorating like clothes and accessories. 
            In other words, the HTML structure can be decorated like a completely different website by changing only the CSS file while leaving it intact.
